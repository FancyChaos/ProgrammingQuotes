ProgrammingQuotes is not meant to be used in a project itself, it's just a funny little program to bring a bit of charm to the terminal world.

To display a quote just type::
        programmingquotes 
into your terminal.

-l/--language
-------------

To specifie the language of the quotes, just pass your language with the -l/--language arguement::
        programmingquotes -l DE

You can specifie multiple languages seperated by whitespaces::
        programmingquotes -l "DE EN"

Just ignore this arguement if you want to display quotes of every language that is supported.

-q/--quotes
-----------

Just displays the amount of quotes in the database::
        programmingquotes -q
